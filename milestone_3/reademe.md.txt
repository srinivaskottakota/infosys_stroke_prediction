Model Evaluation:
Accuracy Comparison:
Logistic Regression:

This model achieves a very high accuracy of 93.93%, significantly outperforming all the other models. Its high accuracy suggests that logistic regression is exceptionally effective for this dataset, which involves predicting binary outcomes (stroke vs. no stroke). Given the nature of the problem, where the goal is to classify individuals into one of two categories, logistic regression is inherently suited for this type of binary classification.
Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regressions:

The three regression models, on the other hand, perform poorly, with accuracy values hovering below 10%. This is a clear indication that these models, although valuable for continuous target variables, are not appropriate when the target is binary. Linear regression and its regularized variants (Lasso and Ridge) are designed to predict continuous values and thus fail to provide meaningful predictions when applied to binary classification tasks.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) Comparison:
Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regressions:

These regression models produce fairly similar RMSE values, all in the range of 22-23%. Although RMSE is a useful metric for continuous predictions, it is less relevant when evaluating classification models like logistic regression. Since these regression models are focused on predicting a continuous outcome (and not a categorical one), their RMSE values reflect how far off their predictions are in terms of numeric prediction, but don't provide any insight into the models' ability to classify binary outcomes.
Logistic Regression:

Despite its high accuracy, Logistic Regression yields a slightly higher RMSE of 24.63%. However, in the context of binary classification, RMSE is not the most appropriate metric. Logistic regression is designed to predict probabilities for binary outcomes and does not focus on minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values in the same way regression models do. Therefore, this slight increase in RMSE is not an issue for classification tasks.
Why Logistic Regression Performs Well:
Logistic regression is specifically tailored for binary classification problems, making it a perfect fit for the given task of predicting whether an individual will experience a stroke (1) or not (0). The relationship between the features (such as age, BMI, gender, smoking status, etc.) and the target variable is inherently linear in this case, which aligns well with the logistic model’s assumptions.

Furthermore, logistic regression generates probabilities that are bounded between 0 and 1, which is ideal when making predictions in a classification context. The output can then be thresholded to assign the most probable class (stroke or no stroke).

Why the Regression Models Don’t Perform Well:
The regression models (Linear, Lasso, and Ridge) all assume that the target variable is continuous, and they predict numerical values. In contrast, the dataset requires a binary prediction (stroke vs. no stroke). Since these models are not designed to handle categorical outcomes, they perform poorly in this classification task.

Linear Regression attempts to predict a continuous value, but this doesn't work well when the target variable is binary. The model produces real-valued outputs, which then need to be thresholded to classify the instances into one of two categories (stroke or no stroke). This results in very poor classification accuracy.

Lasso and Ridge Regressions are variations of linear regression that apply regularization to prevent overfitting. However, the fundamental issue remains that these models are ill-suited for binary classification tasks because they aim to minimize the error in predicting continuous outcomes. As a result, their accuracy remains very low.

Conclusion:
In this analysis, Logistic Regression emerges as the clear winner, with an accuracy of 93.93%. This model is optimized for binary classification, and its performance indicates that the features in the dataset (such as BMI, age, gender, smoking status, etc.) have a strong linear relationship with the target variable (stroke).

The Linear, Lasso, and Ridge regression models, which are better suited for continuous outcomes, fail to achieve useful results in this classification scenario. They show very low accuracy and similar RMSE values, reflecting their inability to address the binary nature of the target variable.

Therefore, Logistic Regression is the most appropriate choice for this dataset, confirming that when dealing with binary outcomes, logistic regression should be prioritized over regression models designed for continuous predictions.

Summary of Findings:
Best Model: Logistic Regression (93.93% Accuracy)
Poor Performers: Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression (Accuracy < 10%)
Metric Consideration: RMSE is less important for classification problems like this, where accuracy is the more appropriate evaluation metric.
